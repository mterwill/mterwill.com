I recently moved south to Atlanta where I work as a Site Reliability Engineer
for [Mailchimp][]. Prior to that I studied Computer Science and Business at the
University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Go Blue!

You can find me on [GitHub][], [Keybase][], and [LinkedIn][]. I occasionally
share my photography on [Instagram][] and [500px][].  Want to get in touch?
[Shoot me an email][email].
