# Interesting links

A collection of links I've found interesting.

* [What makes an expert an expert?][] is one of my favorites. Dan talks about
  the power of mental models and how they enable us to reason about complex
  systems. I'm currently reading [Sources of Power][] and it's a nice
  extension to this post.
* On the topic of effective incident response, in [Troubleshooting On A Distributed Team Without Losing Common Ground][],
  the author suggests using differential diagnosis to slow the breakdown of
  common ground. I'm keeping this one in my pocket and hope to eventually
  experiment with the idea.
* Quantifying customer experience is hard on multiple levels.
  [Latency SLOs Done Right][] hits on this from a technical perspective.
  [Your nines are not my nines][] hits on the human side of things.
* [Getting a Team Back on Track][] talks about the importance of limiting the
  number of streams of work for your team.
* [Web Design in 4 minutes][] is a cool little interactive tutorial where you
  watch a minimal, yet decent-looking, website take form.
* [Linux Performance Analysis in 60,000 Milliseconds][] is my first stop
  whenever it seems like a server's performance is wonky.
* [WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH MY LIFE???][] is a question I struggle to answer.
  This presentation provides a nice lens some helpful prompts on the topic.
* I like [this format][Technical Specs] for tech specs.
* [The 8-Step Process for Leading Change][] gives a useful framework for leading
  change.
* Lara Hogan has a post about our core needs as humans, and what happens
  when those feel violated. She frames it around a relatable topic, [desk moves][].
* Python's docs on [Floating Point Arithmetic][] give an easy-to-understand
  explanation of the limitations in working with binary fractions.
